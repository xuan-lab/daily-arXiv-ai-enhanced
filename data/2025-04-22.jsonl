For experimental verification, we first design a patching-based\nknowledge-scoring algorithm to identify knowledge-aware activation vectors as\nindependent functional components. Then, we conduct counter-knowledge testing\nto examine the independent functional effects of each component on knowledge\nrecall outcomes. From this functional perspective, we improve the contextual\nknowledge editing approach augmented by activation patching. By rewriting\nincoherent activations in context, we enable improved short-term memory\nretention for new knowledge prompting."}

Auditory cues\nguide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic\nguidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues\ncan improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to\nsimultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper,\nand propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video\nsaliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image\ngeneration task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts\nsaliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large\nmultimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and\nintroduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate\nimage-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the\nmodel to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the\ntextual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another\nconditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions\nindicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT)\ndirectly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may\naffect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional\nguidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information\nfrom the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing\nmethods, improving 1.03\\%, 2.35\\%, 2.71\\% and 0.33\\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J\nmetrics, respectively."}

While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking,\nit is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks\nand defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because\nof the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels\nand frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two\nrepresentations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel,\nwe first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame\nadversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a\ntwo-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the\ntarget region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a\ngradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event\nvoxels.

The results show that for\nthe five tutoring strategies, True Negative Rates (TNR) range from 0.655 to\n0.738, and Recall ranges from 0.327 to 0.432, indicating that the model is\neffective at excluding incorrect classifications but struggles to consistently\nidentify the correct strategy.

Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training.

In this work, we address this by\nintroducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with\nmultiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two\ndifferent perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically,\nwe first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into\nmultiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene\nrepresentation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting\ninstances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and\nboundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas.

Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and\nbackground content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like\nimage editing.

This\nhybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly\nintegrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize\nthis bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by\npredicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly\nboosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model\nlong-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal\ntransformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to\ngenerate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise\na layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of\nlow-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening\npredictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by\nscrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding\npredictions.

A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has\nbeen challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this\ntrade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms\nfor language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero\ndensity in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem\nunavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide\nan algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly\npositive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by\nthese algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages\nthey consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may\nrequire oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations.\nOur analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of\nconvergence and limit points playing a key role."}

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency\n(VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data.\nSpecifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it\nintegrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation\n(TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a\nsingle-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it\ndevises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which\nseamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG.\nLeveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from\nsimple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better\ntrade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on\nUCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that\nVFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption\nrobustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%."}

MTS not only reduces the number of parameters required while\nenhancing the efficiency of weight optimization compared to traditional dense\nlayers (i.e., unfactorized weight matrices in MLP layers), but it also\ndemonstrates clear advantages over convolutional layers. The proof-of-concept\nexperimental comparison of the proposed MTS networks with MLPs and\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrates their effectiveness across\nvarious tasks, such as classification, compression, and signal restoration.\nAdditionally, when integrated with modern non-linear units such as the\nmulti-head gate (MHG), also introduced in this study, the corresponding neural\nnetwork, MTSNet, demonstrates a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff\ncompared to state-of-the-art transformers in various computer vision\napplications. The software implementation of the MTS layer and the\ncorresponding MTS-based networks, MTSNets, is shared at\nhttps://github.com/mehmetyamac/MTSNet."}

However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms\nraises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or\ndeliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted\nmaterial, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing\nregulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools\nfor systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM\nhas learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches\ntypically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image\nclassification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt\nuncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges,\nwe introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric\nconcept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection,\nPAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for\noptimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model\nand 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform.\nPAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by\n18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first\nscalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of\ndiffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more\ntransparent diffusion model sharing."}

Through stochastic differential\nequation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup,\nwe demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences\nfairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show\nthat when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and\nstochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher\nlikelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic\ncategory). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees\nshowing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter\nupdates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We\nthen validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly\navailable datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different\ntasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label\nclassification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness\ndefinitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic\nparity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD\nin terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy.\nOur results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked\nmechanism for promoting fair outcomes."}

To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate\nspatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order\nAmbisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio\nthat captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction.\nWe first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is\ncurated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated\npipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate\nspatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio,\nwhich leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in\nFOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a\ndual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to\ncapture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360.

Quadrotors operating in real-world\nenvironments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large\namount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for\nreal-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and\nnoisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying\nlearning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention\nthe infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which\nmakes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,\nflight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and\nhardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables\nquadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in\nseveral minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including\nhovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and\nplanning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through\nextensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed\nsim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world\nperturbations.

EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions,\nincluding safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and\nlanguage features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new\narchitecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises\nkey modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector\napplier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors\nto influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the\nmain advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive\ntechnical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and\nadjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and\nefficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different\nLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques.

Bouman"], "title": "Revealing the 3D Cosmic Web through Gravitationally Constrained Neural Fields", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused\nprimarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our\nwork, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to\nreconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy\nemitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second\nchallenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and\ncan only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces\nan overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal\ncompletely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions\nabout the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a\ngravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous\nmatter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the\nweights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward\nmodel to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We\nshowcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements\nof dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys.\nOur results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but\nimportantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter\nstructures."}
