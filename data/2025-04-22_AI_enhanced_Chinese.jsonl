Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input\nspecifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes\nfrom the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion\ntechniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual\nembedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless\nintegration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental\nresults on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms\nexisting methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing\nfine-grained visual details from retrieved garments.

In both\narchitectures, the encoder often relies heavily on extracting continuous\nrepresentations from the image, which limits the ability to represent\nmeaningful discrete information. To address this limitation, we propose\nsegmentation of the autonomous driving environment using vector quantization.\nVector quantization offers three primary advantages for road environment\nsegmentation. (1) Each continuous feature from the encoder is mapped to a\ndiscrete vector from the codebook, helping the model discover distinct features\nmore easily than with complex continuous features. (2) Since a discrete feature\nacts as compressed versions of the encoder's continuous features, they also\ncompress noise or outliers, enhancing the image segmentation task.

Although they\nyield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This\narchitecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but\nthe meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the\nencoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of\nthe model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective\nrepresentation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and\nparameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key\nlimitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt\ntuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate\ntask-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen\nfoundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific\nvisual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the\nprimary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to\nenforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and\ngenerate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD)\nleverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts,\nthereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing\nCoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms\n13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art\n(with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).\nSource code has been available at https://github.com/WJ-CV/VCP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u5171\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08CoSOD\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ca\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CoSOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u8303\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\uff08VCP\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08CPG\uff09\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u6563\u5668\uff08CPD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684CoCA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVCP\u5728F_m\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.8%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e13\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "VCP\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CoSOD\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684state-of-the-art\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

With the flourishing of\nmultimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency\nprediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues\nguide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic\nguidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues\ncan improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to\nsimultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper,\nand propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video\nsaliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image\ngeneration task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts\nsaliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large\nmultimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and\nintroduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate\nimage-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the\nmodel to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the\ntextual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another\nconditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions\nindicated by sounds.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) plays a significant\nrole in these tasks, offering powerful zero-shot capabilities that allow models\nto perform effectively in unseen domains. However, there remains a significant\ngap in the literature, as no comprehensive survey currently exists that\nsystematically explores the applications of CLIP in DG and DA, highlighting the\nnecessity for this review. This survey presents a comprehensive review of\nCLIP's applications in DG and DA. In DG, we categorize methods into optimizing\nprompt learning for task alignment and leveraging CLIP as a backbone for\neffective feature extraction, both enhancing model adaptability. For DA, we\nexamine both source-available methods utilizing labeled source data and\nsource-free approaches primarily based on target domain data, emphasizing\nknowledge transfer mechanisms and strategies for improved performance across\ndiverse contexts.

While\nrecent diffusion models have shown promise, they often struggle with\nmaintaining coherence between known and unknown (missing) regions. This issue\narises from the lack of explicit spatial and semantic alignment during the\ndiffusion process, resulting in content that does not smoothly integrate with\nthe original image. Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global\nlearned distributions rather than localized features, leading to\ninconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work,\nwe propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive\nDiscrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and\nunknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By\nincorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between\ngenerated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually\naligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism\nthat adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction\ncomplexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and\nintegration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill\noutperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConFill\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8865\u5168\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u539f\u56fe\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConFill\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\uff08CAD\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eConFill\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u6746\u3002", "conclusion": "ConFill\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}

Second,\nwe propose a specialized cross-channel fine-grained loss function designed to\nguide feature groups toward distinct discriminative re-gions of the target,\nthus improving overall target representation. This loss function includes an\ninter-channel loss term that promotes orthogonality be-tween channels,\nmaximizing feature diversity and facilitating finer detail capture.

Traditional methods,\nwhich depend on expert-annotated evidence, are labor-intensive and not\nscalable. Although recent automated systems have improved, they still struggle\nwith complex claims that require nuanced reasoning. To address this, we propose\nCRAVE, a Conflicting Reasoning Approach for explainable claim VErification,\nthat verify the complex claims based on the conflicting rationales reasoned by\nlarge language models (LLMs). Specifically, CRAVE introduces a three-module\nframework. Ambiguity Elimination enchanced Evidence Retrieval module performs\nambiguity elimination and entity-based search to gather relevant evidence\nrelated to claim verification from external sources like Wikipedia. Conflicting\nPerspective Reasoning and Preliminary Judgment module with LLMs adopts LLMs to\nreason rationales with conflicting stances about claim verification from\nretrieved evidence across four dimensions, i.e., direct evidence, semantic\nrelationships, linguistic patterns, and logical reasoning and make a\npreliminary judgment. Finally, Small Language Model (SLM) based Judge module is\nfine-tuned to make use of preliminary judgment from LLMs to assess the\nconfidence of the conflicting rationales and make a final authenticity\njudgment. This methodology allows CRAVE to capture subtle inconsistencies in\ncomplex claims, improving both the accuracy and transparency of claim\nverification. Extensive experiments on two public claim verification datasets\ndemonstrate that our CRAVE model achieves much better performance than\nstate-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for finding relevant\nevidence and explaining the model predictions.

Among various approaches, robust visual tracking\nthat combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention\nfrom researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking,\nit is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks\nand defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because\nof the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels\nand frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two\nrepresentations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel,\nwe first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame\nadversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a\ntwo-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the\ntarget region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a\ngradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event\nvoxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal\nuniversal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal\ndata. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used\nRGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent.

In this study, we investigated the\npotential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78\nsecondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic\neducational settings. In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and\nacoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification\nmodel for CPS diagnosis. Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models\noutperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes. Although the\ninclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional\nunimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated\nimproved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to\nunimodal transformer-based models. Based on the results, the paper argues that\nmultimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not\nbe taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection\nof every CPS subskill and indicator. Rather, their value is limited to certain\ntypes of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and\ndependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset.

With just a single example, they can effectively guide and\nadjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and\nefficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different\nLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques.

However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian\nfashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems. To address\nthis issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the\nintroduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as\na regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from\nunstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch. The\ncharacteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the\nfirst time. Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the\nsingle-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document. A\nvariation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a\nsolution. In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times\nper document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps\nalong the inference process. We have tested our models on two datasets: a\ncollection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a\nlarge-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets.

DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face\nswapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing\nidentity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of\ndiffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss\nfunctions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the\ngenerated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we\nleverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps\nto a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with\nexplicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved\ndiffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter.\nThis robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group\nexplicit supervision.

Such videos entangle the\nmotion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments\nrequired by traditional systems. Existing techniques either filter out dynamic\nelements or model their motion independently. However, the former often results\nin incomplete reconstructions, whereas the latter can lead to inconsistent\nmotion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point\ntracker to separate the camera-induced motion from the observed motion of\ndynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle\nadjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements as a result.

In this\npaper, we introduce Self-sUpervised Direct preference Optimization (SUDO), a\nnovel paradigm that optimizes both fine-grained details at the pixel level and\nglobal image quality. By integrating direct preference optimization into the\nmodel, SUDO generates preference image pairs in a self-supervised manner,\nenabling the model to prioritize global-level learning while complementing the\npixel-level MSE loss. As an effective alternative to supervised fine-tuning,\nSUDO can be seamlessly applied to any text-to-image diffusion model.\nImportantly, it eliminates the need for costly data collection and annotation\nefforts typically associated with traditional direct preference optimization\nmethods. Through extensive experiments on widely-used models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.5 and XL, we demonstrate that SUDO significantly enhances both\nglobal and local image quality.

Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead.

In this work, we address this by\nintroducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with\nmultiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two\ndifferent perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically,\nwe first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into\nmultiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene\nrepresentation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting\ninstances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and\nboundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce\nanother multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level\nperspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also\ntreat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing\nmethods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and\nbackground content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like\nimage editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize\ncontrollable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task.

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the\nEmotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) to endow the\nsegmentation model SAM with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable\nthe model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well,\nwe introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional\ninput for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to\nestablish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more\nimportantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a\nlightweight prefix projector, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask\nwith the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with\nthe language model.Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional\ntokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations.

Here, we investigate the link between real-time\nprocessing in humans and \"layer-time\" dynamics in Transformer models. Across\nfive studies spanning domains and modalities, we test whether the dynamics of\ncomputation in a single forward pass of pre-trained Transformers predict\nsignatures of processing in humans, above and beyond properties of the model's\noutput probability distribution. We consistently find that layer-time dynamics\nprovide additional predictive power on top of output measures.

Recently, supervised learning\napproaches have gained attention for reconstructing 3D spinal anatomy from\nsparse fluoroscopic data, significantly reducing reliance on\nradiation-intensive 3D imaging systems.

They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning\nalgorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and\nfaster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a\ncommon algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised\ntrajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop\nbenchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly\nunderstands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating\nfrom the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this\nlimitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often\nuse original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories\nare heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to\nthe most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen\nsituations.\n  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop\nsimulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal\nbenchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact\nof the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning\nand reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative\napproaches.

TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized\nspatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information\nto lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is\neffectively canceled. TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion\nestimates within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over\nextended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point\ndistributions, we propose a Local Pair Attention mechanism. This 3D\ncontextualization strategy effectively exploits spatial relationships in 3D,\nforming informative feature neighborhoods for precise 3D trajectory estimation.\nOur 3D-centric approach significantly outperforms existing 3D point tracking\nmethods and even enhances 2D tracking accuracy compared to conventional 2D\npixel trackers when accurate depth is available. It supports inference in both\ncamera coordinates (i.e., unstabilized) and world coordinates, and our results\ndemonstrate that compensating for camera motion improves tracking performance.\nOur approach replaces the conventional 2D square correlation neighborhoods used\nin prior 2D and 3D trackers, leading to more robust and accurate results across\nvarious 3D point tracking benchmarks.

Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with\nencouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed\nreasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently\nrobust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing\nagents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit\nreasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and\nerror recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from\nreactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate\nthis transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed\nthrough our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training\napproach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to\nDeliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on\nestablishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to\ntransfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to\nMLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to\nintegrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action\ngeneration. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic\nreasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage\nintroduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for\ngenerating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario\nConstruction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from\nidentified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves\nstrong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks.

This\nhybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly\nintegrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize\nthis bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by\npredicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly\nboosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model\nlong-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal\ntransformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to\ngenerate attention-based predictions for target frames.

A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has\nbeen challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this\ntrade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms\nfor language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero\ndensity in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem\nunavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide\nan algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly\npositive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by\nthese algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages\nthey consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may\nrequire oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations.\nOur analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of\nconvergence and limit points playing a key role.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u6b63\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u5e7f\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u9650\u632f\u8361\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65cf\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose to\naddress this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the\nModality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first\nconstruct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between\npatches. Subsequently, the selective graph nodes swap operation is employed to\nalleviate the adverse effects of low-quality local features by considering both\nlocal and global information, enhancing the representation of discriminative\ninformation. Finally, the swapped modality-aware graphs are fed into the\nlocal-aware graph reasoning module, which propagates multi-modal information to\nyield a reliable feature representation. Another advantage of the proposed\ngraph reasoning approach is its ability to reconstruct missing modal\ninformation by exploiting inherent structural relationships, thereby minimizing\ndisparities between different modalities.

Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with\nadvanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering,\nshowing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines.\nHowever, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to\ntrustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code.\nRecent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky\noutputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain\nunconsciously recognizes its own mistakes. Yet, most of these approaches are\nlimited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving\nindustry-level scalability and practicability. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code\nLLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with\nthe existing infrastructure of software companies. The core idea is that the\nrisk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to\nLLMs. Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on\nlarge-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM\nstates. Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level\nrisk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different\nprogramming languages.

In such complex contexts, the increasing\npattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based\napproaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share\ncompositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high\nfidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2)\ninsufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as\nintricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully\nreconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting\nin false positives.

To concurrently address these two\nchallenges, we propose a Memory-augmented Dual-Decoder Networks (MDD-Net). This\nnetwork includes two critical components: a Dual-Decoder Reverse Distillation\nNetwork (DRD-Net) and a Class-aware Memory Module (CMM). Specifically, the\nDRD-Net incorporates a restoration decoder designed to recover normal features\nfrom synthetic abnormal inputs and an identity decoder to reconstruct features\nthat maintain the anomalous semantics. By exploiting the discrepancy between\nfeatures produced by two decoders, our approach refines anomaly scores beyond\nthe conventional encoder-decoder comparison paradigm, effectively reducing\nfalse positives and enhancing localization accuracy.

Leveraging large vision language model\n(VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video\ntoxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy\nwith rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale\nonline A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the\nbest moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces\nthe user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation\nincreases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several\nKuaishou scenarios.

Specifically, most video\nadversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training\ntimes and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency\n(VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data.\nSpecifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it\nintegrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation\n(TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a\nsingle-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it\ndevises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which\nseamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG.\nLeveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from\nsimple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better\ntrade-off between clean accuracy and robustness.

To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ\na denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the\ndata-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer\nlearning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1)\npre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the\ncomputer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the\npre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are\nupsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow\nstructures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser\neffectively suppresses the noise patterns.

Existing methods often\nstruggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies.\nTo address this issue, we propose \\name{}, a new framework that enhances\ncontrollable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between\nthe second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the\nfirst-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we\nemploy an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an\ninput condition and a text prompt.

Although many previous methods\nattempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances\nexhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes.\nTo address this challenge, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object\npose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with\nlocal-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our approach first\npredicts semantically consistent and geometric informative keypoints through an\nInstance-Adaptive Keypoint Generator, then refines them with: (1) a Local\nKeypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global\nKeypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural\nconsistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a Feature\nSequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing\nbackward feature sequences.

To more efficiently adapt to\nground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing\nexcessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes\nKANet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of 3D KAN Conv and an\nadaptive grid update mechanism. By introducing learnable univariate B-spline\nfunctions on network edges, specifically by flattening three-dimensional\nneighborhoods into vectors and applying B-spline-parameterized nonlinear\nactivation functions to replace the fixed linear weights of traditional 3D\nconvolutional kernels, we precisely capture complex spectral-spatial nonlinear\nrelationships in hyperspectral data. Simultaneously, through a dynamic grid\nadjustment mechanism, we adaptively update the grid point positions of\nB-splines based on the statistical characteristics of input data, optimizing\nthe resolution of spline functions to match the non-uniform distribution of\nspectral features, significantly improving the model's accuracy in\nhigh-dimensional data modeling and parameter efficiency, effectively\nalleviating the curse of dimensionality. This characteristic demonstrates\nsuperior neural scaling laws compared to traditional convolutional neural\nnetworks and reduces overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise\nscenarios.

Experiments demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image\nrestoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both\nsynthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\\% of the\ntraining cost compared to current approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFluxGen\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668FluxIR\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684T2I\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Flux\uff09\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684T2I\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86FluxGen\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9000\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668FluxIR\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684T2I\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u7ea68.5%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FluxGen\u548cFluxIR\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Despite their promising\nperformance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details,\nleading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as\nwell as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed\nSCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb\ntextures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and\ntry-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we\ndevise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow\npath. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's\nbody, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and\npost-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance\nflow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results,\nwe integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network\nbased on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are\nable to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and\nprecise control over details.

The hand-crafted\ndescriptors in classical semantic-aided registration, or the ground-truth\nannotation reliance in learning-based scene graph registration, impede their\napplication in practical real-world environments. To address the challenges, we\ndesign a scene graph network to encode multiple modalities of semantic nodes:\nopen-set semantic feature, local topology with spatial awareness, and shape\nfeature. These modalities are fused to create compact semantic node features.\nThe matching layers then search for correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nIn the back-end, we employ a robust pose estimator to decide transformation\naccording to the correspondences. We manage to maintain a sparse and\nhierarchical scene representation. Our approach demands fewer GPU resources and\nfewer communication bandwidth in multi-agent tasks. Moreover, we design a new\ndata generation approach using vision foundation models and a semantic mapping\nmodule to reconstruct semantic scene graphs. It differs significantly from\nprevious works, which rely on ground-truth semantic annotations to generate\ndata. We validate our method in a two-agent SLAM benchmark. It significantly\noutperforms the hand-crafted baseline in terms of registration success rate.\nCompared to visual loop closure networks, our method achieves a slightly higher\nregistration recall while requiring only 52 KB of communication bandwidth for\neach query frame.

Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure,\ntranslating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic\nactions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the\nPhoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect\nhigh-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In\nthis motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process\nmotion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection\ninto coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion\ninstruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a\nmulti-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual\nobservations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these\ntwo models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the\nlow-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and\nfacilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this\nframework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically\nimprove the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments.

However, in many practical scenarios such as medical\nimaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward\nand usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often\nintroduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and\ninconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in\nprocurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label\nerrors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in\nspatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the\nsame errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian\nestimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes\nlabel errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial\ncorrelations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the\nposterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial\ncorrelations are present.

In our\nwork, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to\nreconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy\nemitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second\nchallenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and\ncan only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces\nan overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal\ncompletely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions\nabout the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a\ngravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous\nmatter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the\nweights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward\nmodel to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We\nshowcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements\nof dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys.\nOur results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but\nimportantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter\nstructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u4ece2D\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u76843D\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7269\u7406\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790-\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u900f\u955c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u610f\u5916\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6697\u7269\u8d283D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}
